## Project: PID Controller
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
---
In this project, we design and implement a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to help navigate a car around a race track given the cross track error.
