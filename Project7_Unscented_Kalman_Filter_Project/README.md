## Project: Unscented Kalman Filter
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
---
In this project, we implement the unscented Kalman filter in C++ using provided LIDAR and RADAR measurements of a bicycle that travels around our car. The objectives of the project can be summarized as below:

* Read the LIDAR and RADAR measurements
* Implement the unscented Kalman filter for LIDAR measurements and extended Kalman filter for RADAR measurements 
* Experiment with process noise parameters corresponding to longitudinal acceleration and yaw acceleration 
* Compare the predicted path with the ground truth results and calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* RMSE Error should be less than [0.09, 0.10, 0.4, 0.3] for the x location (X), y location (Y), x velocity (VX) and y velocity (VY) respectively

## Dependencies
---
* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4
* [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) 

## Instructions to Run
---
* Clone this repo.
* Make a build directory: mkdir build && cd build
* Compile: cmake .. && make
* Run Simulator: Clone [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/) and run it
* Run Code: ./UnscentedKF 

## Selection of Process Noise Parameters
The process noise parameters for the longitudinal acceleration and yaw acceleration are finalized based on the NIS plots. The parameters are adjusted so that around 80% of the NIS values are between 0.35 and 7.815 for RADAR (3 DOF) and between 0.35 and 5.991 for LIDAR (2 DOF). The values 7.815 and 5.991 for RADAR and LIDAR are selected based on the chi square distribution. The final values of standard deviation for longitudinal and yaw acceleration are 1.5 and 0.3 respectively and the NIS for the different time steps for RADAR and LIDAR are shown below.

## Result
---
Currently the results are reported only for Dataset 1
The RMSE values for X, Y, VX and VY are always less than 0.09, 0.10, 0.4 and 0.3 respectively along the entire length of the path. 
The final values of RMSE are:

| Quantity         		|     RMSE	        							|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| X         			| 0.0745   										|
| Y				     	| 0.0805									 	|
| VX					| 0.2767										|
| VY	      			| 0.2438 										|

The bicycle path predicted by the UKF along with the LIDAR, RADAR measurement and Ground truth is shown below. The matlab script post_process.m is used to generate the NIS plot and the UKF predicted path.
