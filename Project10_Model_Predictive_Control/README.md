## Project: Model Predictive Control
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
---
In this project, we design and implement a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to help navigate a car around a race track given the waypoints of the track.

## Dependencies
---
* cmake >= v3.5
* make >= v4.1
* gcc/g++ >= v5.4
* [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) 

## Instructions to Run
---
* Clone this repo.
* Make a build directory: mkdir build && cd build
* Compile: cmake .. && make
* Run Simulator: Clone [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/) and run it
* Run Code: ./mpc

## Result
---
The final implementation of the MPC algorithm with a 100 millisecond latency can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSfGQtFNSi4). The yellow line denotes the waypoints or center of the track. The coordinates can found in lake_track_waypoints.csv. The green line indicates the trajectory predicted by the MPC algorithm.
